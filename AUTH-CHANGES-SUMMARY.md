# Authentication System Updates

## Summary of Changes

We've completed a comprehensive update of the authentication system to properly separate the two authentication mechanisms:

1. **Web User Authentication** (for user identification and preventing duplicate bookings)
2. **Kaze API Authentication** (for communicating with the Kaze backend system)

## Changes Made

- **Enhanced `kaze-client.ts`** to remove client-side token requirements for Kaze API operations
- **Updated `/app/api/cal/bookings/route.ts`** to clearly separate user authentication from Kaze API authentication
- **Improved `/app/api/kaze/test-token/route.ts`** to verify and explain both authentication systems
- **Created new testing scripts**:
  - `test-both-auth.sh` to test both authentication systems simultaneously
  - Enhanced existing scripts for better diagnostics
- **Added documentation**:
  - Created `AUTHENTICATION.md` with a detailed explanation of the authentication systems
  - Updated `auth-fixes-readme.md` with the latest fixes

## How to Test

Run the following scripts to test the authentication systems:

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Test each authentication system
./test-auth.sh
./test-booking-flow.sh
./test-both-auth.sh
```

## Next Steps

- Monitor the system to ensure both authentication methods are working properly
- Consider implementing refresh token functionality for long-lived sessions
- Add more comprehensive logging for authentication-related operations
